### Blockchain
This is my Project on Blockhains. It simulates mining of cryptocurrency by creating blocks using hashing and multithreading. It also contains its own currency, which is rewarded to miners for creating a block and they can use it virtually to purchase things.

### About
Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed. Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology. This is my Project on Blockhain. It simulates mining of cryptocurrency by creating blocks using hashing and multithreading. It also contains its own currency, which is rewarded to miners for creating a block and they can use it virtually to purchase things.

### Learning outcomes
I learned: Built a profound understanding of how blockchains work, applied my hashing and multithreading skills and learned about (de)serialization.
